## What is TeamUp?

**TeamUp** is a full-stack Single Page Application built to centralize the management of collaborative events such as hackathons, integrative projects, and innovative coding challenges. From team formation and GitHub repository automation to AI-powered project search and real-time QR voting — everything lives in one platform.

The main roles are **ADMIN**, **TEAM_LEAD**, and **USER**. Each role has differentiated access to the system's features.

---
## Overview

TeamUp was built to solve a real pain point at **RIWI**: collaborative events like the *Proyecto Integrador* were managed through a fragmented collection of spreadsheets, discord groups, and manual processes. TeamUp replaces all of that with a single, role-aware platform.

**The problem it solves:**

| Before TeamUp | With TeamUp |
|---|---|
| Scattered information across tools | Single source of truth for the entire event |
| Manual GitHub repo setup per team | Automatic repo + permissions via n8n workflow |
| Paper/spreadsheet evaluations | Structured rubric-based scoring with area TLs |
| No public participation mechanism | QR code voting with live real-time results |
| No ranking transparency | Weighted automatic ranking (80/20 formula) |
| Duplicate/redundant projects go undetected | AI-powered semantic similarity search |


## General Architecture

The project is split into three independent repositories:

```
/
├── back-end/        → REST API with Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
└── front-end/       → SPA with Vanilla JavaScript + Vite
└── docs/            → Docusaurus Documentation
```

The backend exposes a REST API at `/api/*` and also manages real-time connections via **Socket.IO**. The frontend consumes the API and communicates with the socket server to update voting results live.

Backend and Frontend repositories, both run independently in development and integrate through CORS configured on the backend.

## System Modules

### Auth
User registration, login, and token refresh with JWT. OAuth support for **GitHub** and **Google (Firebase)**. Tokens are managed via `httpOnly` cookies.

### Users
User profile management. Profile photo upload via Cloudinary.

### Teams
Team creation and administration. Email invitations and join requests.

### Projects
Each team registers their project with a name, description, and preview photo. Projects are linked to an event.

### Events
Admins create and configure events. Each event groups teams, projects, and evaluation sessions.

### Evaluations
Criteria-based evaluation system. Evaluators grade projects and the system calculates the weighted final score.

### Ranking
Automatic team ranking calculated from evaluations. Used to determine finalists for each event.

### Finalists
Module for approving and publishing the finalists podium for an event.

### QR Votes
Public voting via QR code. The admin generates a QR pointing to a public page where attendees vote for their favorite project. Results update in real time with Socket.IO. Includes IP-based anti-fraud.

### Comments
Comments on projects, visible in the project detail view.

### Emails
Transactional email sending with Nodemailer for invitation and assignment notifications.

### Upload
File and image uploads to Cloudinary.

### GitHub Integration
Webhook to record activity from GitHub repositories linked to projects. GitHub OAuth authentication support.

### Custom SPA Router
```
Router
  ├── route registry     ← maps paths to view functions
  ├── ROUTE_PERMISSIONS  ← maps paths to allowed roles
  ├── navigate(path)     ← pushState + view rendering
  └── onLangChange()     ← re-renders current view on language switch
```

### React + TypeScript Incremental Migration

New React modules live under `src/react` and are mounted from Vanilla views through a
small island adapter. The migration convention, folder boundaries, lifecycle rules and
router retirement path are documented in [`docs/react-migration.md`](docs/react-migration.md).

The router enforces **RBAC at the client level** (mirrored server-side). Unauthenticated or unauthorized users are redirected before any view renders.

### View Lifecycle
```
navigate(path)
  → matchRoute()
    → checkPermissions()
      → destroyCurrentView()     ← cleanup listeners & sockets
        → renderView()           ← inject HTML into #app
          → initView()           ← bind events, fetch data, connect sockets
```

### Backend Structure
```
src/
  ├── routes/         ← Express routers per resource
  ├── controllers/    ← Request handlers
  ├── services/       ← Business logic
  ├── middlewares/    ← Auth, RBAC, validation
  ├── models/         ← DB query functions (raw SQL + pg)
  └── sockets/        ← Socket.IO event handlers
```
---

### Database

Migrations are located in `back-end/src/db/migrations/`. Run them in order against your PostgreSQL database:

```
001_initial.sql
002_refresh_tokens.sql
003_github_tokens.sql
004_teams_invitations.sql
005_projects_fields.sql
005_team_join_requests.sql
006_events_table.sql
007_events_github_org.sql
008_create_crudzaso_event.sql
009_project_submitted.sql
```

You can run them from the Supabase SQL Editor or with `psql`:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f src/db/migrations/001_initial.sql
```
